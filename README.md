## üìù Learning & Challenges
- Gained proficiency in writing complex multi-table JOINs and utilizing CTEs for clearer query structures.
- A specific challenge involved calculating total sales by various "types" from a single table, without a dedicated product type column. This led me to effectively utilize the "UNION ALL" method. This experience deepened my understanding of how to combine and structure data from different parts of a table or similar tables to achieve specific aggregated reporting views, showcasing adaptability in querying diverse data structures for analytical purposes.
